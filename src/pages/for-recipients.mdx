# You've Received Something Prayerfully Made

_The sticker in your hands was created through prayer, with you in mind—even if the person who made it didn’t yet know your name._

> [“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you.”](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/jeremiah/1?5)  
> — **Jeremiah 1:5 (NABRE)**

## Prayer Across Time

When someone made your sticker, they weren’t just cutting paper—they were **offering intercessory prayer**, joining their heart to Christ. As they cut around each edge, they may have recited Hail Marys or Our Fathers, lifting up an unknown recipient—**you**—to God.

Yes, really. In the mystery of God’s providence, their prayers were already being directed toward the person who would receive the sticker, even before they knew who that would be. And because God is eternal—outside of time—He is able to apply the merits and intentions of prayers across time. In this way, a prayer made in the past can be joined to a moment in your present.

> ["With the Lord one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years like one day."](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/2peter/3?8)  
> — **2 Peter 3:8 (NABRE)**

> ["In him we live and move and have our being."](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/acts/17?28)  
> — **Acts 17:28 (NABRE)**

> “To God, all moments of time are present in their immediacy.”  
> — [CCC §600](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/600.htm)

:::info The Theology of Intercessory Prayer

> “Since Abraham, intercession—asking on behalf of another—has been characteristic of a heart attuned to God’s mercy.”  
> — [CCC §2635](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2635.htm)

Catholics believe that when we pray for others, we participate in Christ’s eternal priesthood (cf. [**Hebrews 7:25**](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/hebrews/7?25)). Your sticker is more than decoration—it’s a small artifact of intercession, a tangible sign that someone prayed for you in union with Jesus Himself.

Explore the mystery of how God, who exists outside of time, can unite prayers offered in one moment to graces received in another. This insight has been explored deeply in Catholic theology:

- [St. Augustine, _Confessions_, Book XI (On Time and Eternity)](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/110111.htm)
- [St. Thomas Aquinas, _Summa Theologiae_, I, Q.14–23 (On God’s Knowledge and Providence)](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1014.htm)

These works help unpack how intercessory prayer participates in God's eternal now, making even small acts—like preparing a prayer sticker—mystically connected to others beyond time.

## A Gift of Love

The person who gave you this sticker chose to spend their time praying for you. In our fast-paced world, time is among the most precious gifts. Instead of rushing through their day, they paused—heart aligned with heaven—to lift you up, not by name perhaps, but in intention.

> [“Your every act should be done with love.”](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/1corinthians/16?14)  
> — **1 Corinthians 16:14 (NABRE)**

> “By prayer every baptized person works for the coming of the Kingdom.”  
> — [CCC §2632](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2632.htm)

## The Communion of Saints

This sticker also connects you to a deeper truth: the **Communion of Saints**—the invisible network of grace that binds all who are in Christ.

> “Being more closely united to Christ, those who dwell in heaven fix the whole Church more firmly in holiness... They do not cease to intercede.”  
> — [CCC §956](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/956.htm)

When someone prayed over this sticker, they became a small but real participant in this great communion. Their prayer—offered in secret—joined the liturgy of the saints, echoing across time and space.

> [“For as in one body we have many parts, and all the parts do not have the same function, so we, though many, are one body in Christ and individually parts of one another.”](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/romans/12?4)  
> — **Romans 12:4–5 (NABRE)**

> [“In all circumstances give thanks, for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.”](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/1thessalonians/5?18)  
> — **1 Thessalonians 5:18 (NABRE)**

> — **Matthew 10:8 (NABRE)**

## A Personal Message

:::tip You are loved.  
Someone took time out of their day to pray for you—a person they may never meet. This is a glimpse of God’s own love: personal, unearned, powerful. As **St. Thérèse of Lisieux** said, “What matters in life is not great deeds, but great love.”

You are not forgotten. You are part of something greater. You are remembered in prayer.
