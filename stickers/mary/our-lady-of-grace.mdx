## About This Image

This image portrays a Christian reflection on Genesis 3:15:

> I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; they will strike at your head, while you strike at their heel.
>
> — Genesis 3:15 (NABRE)

Mary, the mother of Jesus, is shown with her foot upon the serpent, while the Christ Child places His foot upon hers. This composition symbolizes that the power conquering evil comes from Christ Himself, yet His Mother shares uniquely in that victory through her faithful cooperation with God's saving plan.

In Catholic tradition, this scene represents the fulfillment of God's first promise of redemption. Mary is called the New Eve because her obedient "yes" to God at the Annunciation reversed the disobedience of the first woman, Eve. By freely consenting to bear the Savior, she became the vessel through whom the Redeemer entered the world.

Catholics also speak of the Immaculate Conception—Mary's being preserved by God from original sin from the first moment of her existence. This grace prepared her to be a pure dwelling place for Christ and to share fully, though dependently, in His triumph over sin and death. Her victory is not her own: it is Christ's victory, which she participates in perfectly through His power and grace.

Together, the Mother and Child embody the fulfillment of God's promise: the serpent is crushed, evil is defeated, and humanity's story is renewed in Christ.
