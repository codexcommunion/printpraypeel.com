# St. Michael - Principalities Beware

This powerful circular badge design depicts St. Michael the Archangel triumphantly defeating the red dragon with his spear, surrounded by the bold declaration "PRINCIPALITIES BEWARE" with the biblical reference Ephesians 6:12.

## About This Design

The striking black and white design with red accents shows St. Michael in his role as the warrior angel, specifically addressing the "principalities and powers" mentioned in Ephesians 6:12. The circular badge format gives it a military or tactical feel, perfect for those engaged in spiritual warfare.

## Biblical Foundation

**Ephesians 6:12**: _"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places."_

This verse reminds us that our true battle is spiritual, and St. Michael leads the charge against these dark forces.
