## About This Image

This circular badge design boldly depicts St. Michael the Archangel conquering the red dragon with his spear, surrounded by the striking declaration "PRINCIPALITIES BEWARE" and the Scripture reference Ephesians 6:12.

Rendered in bold black and white with vivid red accents, the image shows St. Michael in his role as heavenly warrior, confronting the demonic powers described in Scripture:

> For our struggle is not with flesh and blood but with the principalities, with the powers, with the world rulers of this present darkness, with the evil spirits in the heavens.
>
> — Ephesians 6:12 (NABRE)

In Catholic tradition, St. Michael is the defender of God's people and leader of the heavenly hosts against Satan and his fallen angels. His name—Michael, meaning "Who is like God?"—is a cry of victory affirming God's supremacy over all evil.

The motto "Principalities Beware" proclaims that defiance of darkness: a warning to the spiritual powers opposed to God that Christ's victory is complete. St. Michael's defeat of the dragon represents Christ's ultimate triumph over sin and death, and the believer's participation in that triumph through faith, prayer, and perseverance.

The circular badge format gives the design a strong, military character—fitting for those who "put on the armor of God" (Eph 6:11). It serves as both a symbol of courage and a reminder that our true battle is not against human foes, but against the powers of evil—and that in Christ, those powers are already overcome.
