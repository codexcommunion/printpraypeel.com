## Prerequisites

You'll need a few basic supplies to get started. Most of these you likely already have at home.

### Required Materials

**Printer**
- Any home inkjet or laser printer
- Set to "Best" or "Photo" quality for optimal results

**Sticker Paper**
- Full-sheet sticker paper (letter or A4 size)
- Recommended: Avery Full-Sheet Labels or Cricut Printable Sticker Paper
- Choose matte for general use, glossy for vibrant colors, or waterproof for durability

**Scissors**
- Standard household scissors work fine
- Precision scissors with pointed tips are helpful for detailed designs

### Optional Supplies
- **Craft knife and cutting mat** - for intricate designs
- **Clear spray sealer** - protects inkjet prints from smudging
- **Clear packaging tape** - can be applied over sticker ink to protect it from smudging
- **Paper trimmer** - for straight cuts
- **Circle punch** - for perfectly round stickers


### Where to Buy

Find supplies at craft stores (Michaels, Hobby Lobby), office stores (Staples), or online retailers (Amazon).

## Instructions

### Step 1: Find and Download Stickers

1. Browse our [sticker collection](/stickers) to find designs you like
2. Choose from seasonal designs, saint-themed stickers, Scripture verses, or Marian devotionals
3. Download the PDF files (ready to print) or individual PNG files
4. Save files to your computer where you can easily find them

### Step 2: Print Your Stickers

**Print Settings:**
1. Set print quality to "Best" or "Photo Quality"
2. Select "Actual Size" or "100%" (not "Fit to Page")
3. For inkjet printers, choose "Photo Paper" or "Glossy Paper" as paper type
4. Disable "fast" or "draft" printing modes

**Printing Tips:**
- **Inkjet printers**: Allow 15-30 minutes drying time before handling
- **Laser printers**: Use "heavy paper" settings; ensure your sticker paper is laser-compatible
- Fan sticker paper sheets before loading to prevent jams
- Handle paper by edges only to avoid fingerprints

:::warning
Never use inkjet-only sticker paper in a laser printer! The heat can damage your printer.

### Step 3: Cut While Praying

This is the heart of the PrintPrayPeel practice - transforming cutting into prayer time.

**Prepare Your Space:**
1. Find a quiet location free from distractions
2. Clear your workspace and consider lighting a candle
3. Have a prayer book or Bible nearby if desired
4. Set aside dedicated time - don't rush this process

**Cutting Technique:**
1. Cut around the general outline first, leaving a small margin
2. Make smooth, continuous cuts rather than choppy ones
3. Rotate the paper (not your scissors) for curved edges
4. Trim closer to the design in a second pass if needed

**Prayer Integration:**
- **Begin with an opening prayer** to set your intention
- **Pray for specific people** as you cut each sticker
- **Offer each completed sticker** for a particular intention
- **End with gratitude** for the time spent in prayer
- **Prayer Suggestions** each sticker comes with suggested prayers on the sticker page, or pray whatever is in your heart!

## Tips & Tricks

### Preventing Smudging
- **Apply clear masking tape** over inkjet prints before cutting to prevent smudging or **Use clear spray sealer** on printed stickers before handling/cutting
- Allow 15-30 minutes drying time before handling inkjet prints
- If you your hands are prone to sweating you can also wear vinyl/latex gloves

### Better Cutting Results
- Use sharp scissors dedicated to paper cutting only
- Work in a well-lit area for detailed designs
- For intricate designs, you can leave a small white border rather than cutting precisely
- Rotate the paper (not your scissors) when cutting curves
- Use a craft knife for intricate designs (fixed and rotary blade knives can be used)

### Application Tips for Optimal Results
- **Clean surfaces** with rubbing alcohol before applying stickers
- **Peel slowly** - bend the backing paper to loosen edges first
- **Smooth from center outward** to prevent air bubbles
- For best adhesion, apply to smooth, non-porous surfaces

### Sharing Ideas
- Include stickers with handwritten notes or greeting cards
- Create themed sticker sheets as gifts for special occasions
- Share with fellow parishioners, prayer groups, or religious education classes
- Use on personal items: prayer journals, water bottles, laptops
- Only apply stickers to your own property, or with permission from others.

### Troubleshooting
- **Colors look different**: Adjust printer settings to "vivid" or replace low ink
- **Paper jams**: Fan sheets before loading, use one sheet at a time for thick paper
- **Poor adhesion**: Clean surface first and press firmly across entire sticker
