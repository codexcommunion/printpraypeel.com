# How to Make Prayer Stickers

> “Let all that you do be done in love.”  
> — *1 Corinthians 16:14 (NABRE)*

**PrintPrayPeel** transforms ordinary crafting into prayerful reflection.  
Each sticker you make becomes a small act of devotion—a prayer offered with your hands.  
This guide will walk you through the simple threefold rhythm: **Print**, **Pray**, and **Peel**.

## ✨ What You’ll Need

Gather a few simple materials.  
Each one can become an instrument of prayer.

- **Sticker Paper:** Full-sheet paper (matte, glossy, or waterproof)  
- **Scissors or Craft Knife:** Choose what feels comfortable and controlled  
- **Optional:** Clear spray sealer or masking tape for protection, cutting mat, circle punch, or paper trimmer

## 🪶 Step 1: Print

1. Visit the [Sticker Collection](/stickers) and choose designs that speak to your heart—seasonal devotions, saints, Scripture, or Marian themes.  
2. Download the PDF or PNG files and save them locally.  
3. Print on full-sheet sticker paper using your best print settings (Actual Size, “Best” or “Photo” quality).  
4. Allow ink to dry fully before handling.

:::warning
Never use inkjet-only sticker paper in a laser printer. The heat can damage your printer.

## 🙏 Step 2: Pray While You Create

This is the heart of PrintPrayPeel—the **“Pray”** in the middle of every action.  

Set aside a quiet moment. Light a candle, take a breath, and let your workspace become a small chapel of peace.  
As you cut, trace, or trim, let each movement become a rhythm of prayer.

Each sticker page includes suggested prayers that connect to its theme.  
You can pray those words or simply speak to God in your own.

## 🌸 Step 3: Peel and Share

When your stickers are ready, peel and place them wherever daily life unfolds—on your journal, water bottle, laptop, phone case, guitar, planner, or luggage.  

Each small image becomes a quiet testimony of faith in the ordinary places you go.

By displaying a sticker on your own belongings, you create small moments of evangelization. Someone passing by in an office, classroom, café, or airport might notice a prayer, a saint, or a symbol—and pause to think of God, even if only for a moment.  
In a busy world, these gentle reminders of truth and beauty can open hearts in ways words sometimes cannot.

You can also share stickers as gifts: tuck one into a handwritten note, include them with greeting cards, or give a full sheet to a friend or family member. Each sticker carries the intention you prayed for and continues that prayer wherever it travels.

> “Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your heavenly Father.”  
> — *Matthew 5:16 (NABRE)*
