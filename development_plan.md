# Development Plan for PrintPrayPeel.com

## 📋 Project Overview

PrintPrayPeel.com is a spiritual community website that provides printable prayer stickers. Users can download PDF sticker templates, print them, pray while cutting them out, and share them with others to spread positivity and invite people to the community.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

1. Create an intuitive, beautiful website for browsing and downloading sticker templates
2. Provide a meaningful spiritual experience through prayer integration
3. Foster community sharing and growth
4. Maintain simplicity - no backend, pure static site
5. Ensure mobile-responsive design for accessibility

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

- **Why Docusaurus?**
  - Excellent for content-heavy sites
  - Built-in documentation features
  - React-based for custom components
  - SEO-friendly out of the box
  - Easy GitHub Pages deployment
  - Great performance and mobile responsiveness

### Deployment Strategy
- **GitHub Pages**: Perfect for static sites, free hosting, automatic deployment
